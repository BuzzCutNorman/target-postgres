# target-postgres

`target-postgres` is a Singer target for PostgreSQL. !!! Warning !!! really early version.  It works ok üòê. 

Build with the [Meltano Target SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com).
### Whats New üõ≥Ô∏èüéâ
**2023-10-16 Upgraded to Meltano Singer-SDK 0.32.0:** SQLAlchemy 2.x is main stream in this version so I took advantage of that and bumped from `1.4.x` to `2.x`.  SQLAlchemy supports `psycopg` so I added it as a dependency and you can now use it as a driver option. In the `hd_jsonschema_types` the `minimum` and `maximum` values used to define `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` precision and scale values were being rounded.  This caused an issue with the translation on the target side.  I leveraged scientific notation to resolve this.

**2023-04-26 New HD JSON Schema Types:**  Added translations for HD JSON Schema definitions of Xml and Binary types from the buzzcutnorman `tap-mssql`.  This is Thanksüôè to Singer-SDK 0.24.0 which allows for JSON Schema `contentMediaType` and `contentEncoding`.  Currently all Binary data types are decoded before being inserted as BYTEA.  XML types are not supported in SQLAlchemy for PostgreSQL so are they are inserted as TEXT.

**2023-02-23 Higher Defined(HD) JSON Schema types:**  Translates the Higher Defined(HD) JSON Schema types from the buzzcutnorman `tap-mssql` back into PostgreSQL data types.  You can give it a try by setting `hd_jsonschema_types` to `True` in your config.json or meltano.yml

## Installation
Install from GitHub:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/BuzzCutNorman/target-postgres.git
```

Install using [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com) as a [Custom Plugin](https://docs.meltano.com/guide/plugin-management#custom-plugins)

A full list of supported settings and capabilities for this
target is available by running:

```bash
target-postgres --about
```

### Configure using environment variables

This Singer target will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory's
`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching
environment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.

### Source Authentication and Authorization

<!--
Developer TODO: If your target requires special access on the destination system, or any special authentication requirements, provide those here.
-->

## Usage

You can easily run `target-postgres` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).
<!--
### Executing the Target Directly

```bash
target-postgres --version
target-postgres --help
# Test using the "Carbon Intensity" sample:
tap-carbon-intensity | target-postgres --config /path/to/target-postgres-config.json
```

## Developer Resources

Follow these instructions to contribute to this project.

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `target_postgres/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `target-postgres` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run target-postgres --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://meltano.com/)

_**Note:** This target will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

<!--
Developer TODO:
Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any "TODO" items listed in
the file.
-->
<!--
Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd target-postgres
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke target-postgres --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline with the Carbon Intensity sample tap:
meltano elt tap-carbon-intensity target-postgres
```
-->
